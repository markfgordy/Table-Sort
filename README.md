Table-Sort
==========

This is a group of tables where each table contains a list.  You can maximize/minimize each table and move each table within its container.  Within each table there is a list of text fields.  Each text field can also be moved with its table or move to another table with automatic reordering.

I used the jQueryâ€™s UI Sortable interaction and Accordion widget.  I took js/css attributes from both, added some of my own js/css, to create this accordion/sortable table. 

Example: Split up 100 people into 20 groups of 5.  This tool could to move people from group to group while moving whole groups within a container.  You can rank/order each group, rank/order each person within each group, etc.
